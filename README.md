# DevOps version of the Spring PetClinic Sample Application

The objective of this repo is to apply the DevOps principles to the Spring PetClinic sample application.
We built a CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline to containerized the microservices and deploy the app in a EKS cluster.

## Description
This repository contains the source code of our Java Spring Boot application designed to operate within a microservices architecture. It consists of four microservices:

    api gateway
    vets-services
    visits-services
    customers-services

Each services except the api-gateway have a mysql database attached in the eks cluster to store the datas.

## Technologies

    Java
    Spring Boot
    Maven (for Build)
    Docker (for containerization)
    Kubernetes / HELM (for orchestration)
    AWS (for CI CD) : CodePipeline, ECR, EKS
    Terraform (for IaC)
    Prometheus/Grafana (for monitoring)
    
## Directory Structure
    
    spring-petclinic-api-gateway/ - Source code & DockerFile for the API Gateway microservice.
    spring-petclinic-vets-services/ - Source code & DockerFile for the Vets microservice.
    spring-petclinic-visits-services/ - Source code & DockerFile for the Visits microservice.
    spring-petclinic-customers-services/ - Source code & DockerFile for the Customers microservice.
    K8S/ - Objects & Helms charts for deploy in K8S
    
## Starting services locally with docker-compose
In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing `./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker` 
from a project root. Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command
`docker-compose up`. Containers startup order is coordinated with [`dockerize` script](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize). 
After starting services, it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry,
so don't be scared of initial Spring Cloud Gateway timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard
available by default at http://localhost:8761.




## Custom metrics monitoring

Grafana and Prometheus are included in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, and the public facing applications
have been instrumented with [MicroMeter](https://micrometer.io) to collect JVM and custom business metrics.

A JMeter load testing script is available to stress the application and generate metrics: [petclinic_test_plan.jmx](spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/test/jmeter/petclinic_test_plan.jmx)

### Using Prometheus

* Prometheus can be accessed from your local machine at http://localhost:9091

### Using Grafana with Prometheus

* An anonymous access and a Prometheus datasource are setup.
* A `Spring Petclinic Metrics` Dashboard is available at the URL http://localhost:3000/d/69JXeR0iw/spring-petclinic-metrics.
You will find the JSON configuration file here: [docker/grafana/dashboards/grafana-petclinic-dashboard.json]().
* You may create your own dashboard or import the [Micrometer/SpringBoot dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) via the Import Dashboard menu item.
The id for this dashboard is `4701`.

### Custom metrics
Spring Boot registers a lot number of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback... 
The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC.
All those three REST controllers `OwnerResource`, `PetResource` and `VisitResource` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at class level.

* `customers-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.owner`
  * @Timed: `petclinic.pet`
* `visits-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.visit`

## Interesting Spring Petclinic Infos & forks

The Spring Petclinic `main` branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.

This microservices branch was initially derived from [AngularJS version](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular1) to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).
To achieve that goal, we use Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, Spring Cloud Config, Micrometer Tracing, Resilience4j, Open Telemetry 
and the Eureka Service Discovery from the [Spring Cloud Netflix](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix) technology stack.
